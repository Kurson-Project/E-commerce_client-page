    "question": "How does Lumino pricing work?",
    "answer":
      "At Lumino, we operate on a one-time purchase model — meaning you only pay once for each product and receive lifetime access without any recurring fees. Each digital product (such as templates, AI tools, or system components) is priced individually based on its features, usage license, and included support. All prices are clearly displayed on the product pages, and we frequently offer promotions or bundles for additional savings."

    "question": "Can I cancel or request a refund after purchasing?",
    "answer":
      "Because our products are delivered digitally and accessible immediately after purchase, all sales are considered final. This policy helps us prevent misuse or unauthorized distribution. However, we understand that issues can arise. If you encounter technical problems or believe there's been a mistake with your order, please contact our support team within 7 days of purchase. We're committed to ensuring customer satisfaction and may offer a replacement or partial refund in specific, verified cases."

Please refer to the specific licensing details listed on each product page, as some items may have usage limitations (e.g., not for resale or redistribution). If you're unsure whether your use case is permitted, our licensing team is happy to clarify."
